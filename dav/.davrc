#  QUIT : Exits out of Dav
#  UNDO : Undoes your last action
#  COMPILE : Runs a Makefile and displays error messages
#  TOGGLE_AUTOINDENT : Toggles auto indenting
#  TOGGLE_BOTTOM_ROW : Switches between displaying Fn bindings and file name
#  PREV : Switches to the previous text buffer (of 10)
#  NEXT : Switches to the next text buffer (of 10)
